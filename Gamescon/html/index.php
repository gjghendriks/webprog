<h1>Welcome to GamesCon</h1>
<p>

Gamescon is the largest congress, trade fair and event highlight for interactive games in the world. More than 335,000 visitors celebrated, learned about and enjoyed the next generation of gaming on the Gamescon of 2014. The journey will continue. Together with our visitors we are ready to discover new worlds in 2016, too.<br />

The 10th edition of Gamescon, will take place in Toronto, Canada somewhere in the fall of 2016 and will last a total of two days. This event will be hosted by a collaboration of Gamefreak, Mojang and Nintendo. Further information will be available in due course.</p>
